# techBoxes

A grid with color boxes that change when you hover over them.

* You must click on "play the game" first.
* When the mouse hovers over each square, they change to a random color and add a shadow.
* The shadow is removed when the mouse is not hovering.

This consists of a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
